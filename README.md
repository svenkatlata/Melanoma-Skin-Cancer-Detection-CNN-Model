## General Information
### Introduction

Skin cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer worldwide, with melanoma being its most aggressive and life-threatening type. Early detection is crucial, as it significantly improves survival rates and treatment outcomes. Melanoma arises from melanocytes, the cells responsible for producing pigment in the skin. Although it accounts for only a small fraction of skin cancer cases, it is responsible for 75% of skin cancer-related deaths, underscoring the critical need for timely diagnosis and treatment.

### Background

Traditional methods for melanoma diagnosis involve visual inspections by dermatologists and the use of dermoscopy tools. While these methods are effective, they require specialized expertise and can be time-consuming. With advancements in medical imaging and machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI) presents an opportunity to augment dermatological diagnostics by providing automated, accurate, and fast detection of melanoma. A well-trained AI system can assist healthcare professionals by evaluating skin lesion images and flagging potentially cancerous cases for further analysis, thereby reducing the workload and improving diagnostic accuracy.

### Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop a **multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) in TensorFlow** that can accurately detect melanoma from images of skin lesions. Given the high mortality rate associated with melanoma, an automated detection system can play a crucial role in early diagnosis and treatment. By leveraging deep learning, this solution aims to minimize the manual effort required by dermatologists and ensure consistent, reliable evaluations of skin lesion images. The proposed system will act as a decision-support tool, helping to identify melanoma cases efficiently and potentially saving lives.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of **2,357 images** representing both malignant and benign oncological diseases. It is derived from the **International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)**, a widely recognized source of dermatological imaging data. The dataset is meticulously organized according to the ISIC classification system, ensuring consistency and reliability for training and evaluation. 

The images are divided into subsets with an approximately equal distribution, except for melanomas and moles, which are slightly more prevalent. This reflects the practical scenario where certain conditions may occur more frequently. 

The dataset includes the following skin conditions:  

#### **Pre-Malignant Disease**
1. **Actinic Keratosis:** A precancerous, rough, scaly skin patch from sun damage.

#### **Malignant Diseases**
1. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC):** A slow-growing skin cancer from basal cells.  
2. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC):** A potentially invasive cancer from squamous cells.  
3. **Melanoma:** The most aggressive skin cancer from pigment-producing cells.

#### **Benign Diseases**
1. **Dermatofibroma:** A harmless, firm skin growth, often on the legs.  
2. **Nevus (Mole):** A benign collection of melanocytes (pigment cells).  
3. **Pigmented Benign Keratosis:** Non-cancerous pigmented, rough skin patches.  
4. **Seborrheic Keratosis:** Waxy, raised, benign skin growths.  
5. **Vascular Lesion:** Non-cancerous blood vessel abnormalities.

This comprehensive dataset serves as the foundation for building and validating the CNN-based melanoma detection model, enabling it to learn from a diverse range of skin conditions and improving its accuracy and generalizability in real-world applications.
